    <h1>Instructions on how to use the API</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The base URL is:</p>
    <p>http://ltdemos.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/cam-api?fs=FS&objectA=OBJA&objectB=OBJB&aspect1=ASP1&weight1=WEIGHT1</p>
    <p>replace FS with true if you want to do a fast comparison or with false if you want to do a default comparison which
      is more accurate but takes longer. This is mandatory.</p>
    <p>replace OBJA and OBJB with the objects you want to compare, e. g. OBJA with dog and OBJB with cat. These are
      both mandatory.</p>
    <p>replace ASP1 and WEIGHT1 with an aspect you want to include in the search requests and the weight you want to have
      it, e. g. ASP1 with price and WEIGHT1 with 5.</p>
    <p>add as many aspects/weights as you want as long as you follow these rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you always have to enter both an aspect and its weight. you can't enter one without the other.</li>
      <li>you always have to start with aspect1 and weight1, then aspect2 and weight2 and so forth. Don't skip a number as all
        numbers after that will not be read (order doesn't matter, as long as they exist somewhere in the URL).</li>
      <li>aspects/weights are optional and can be skipped completely if you just want to compare two objects without any aspects
        added.
      </li>
      <li>if you want the results to resemble those you'd get using the Frontend, use values from 1 to 5 for the weights as you
        can't enter other values in the frontend. The search will also work for other values though. Be careful with entering
        negative values or values close to an Integer overflow as they can produce unexpected results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>example for a good URL:</p>
    <a href="http://ltdemos.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/cam-api?fs=false&objectA=dog&objectB=cat&aspect1=size&weight1=3&aspect2=food&weight2=1">http://ltdemos.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/cam-api?fs=false&objectA=dog&objectB=cat&aspect1=size&weight1=3&aspect2=food&weight2=1</a>
